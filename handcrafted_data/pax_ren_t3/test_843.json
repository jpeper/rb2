  "Answer_str": "1. Purchase --- Spend 2 florins to buy Sophia Palaiologina card from market; 2. Play --- play Sophia Palaiologina card, launch Coronation one-shot, move the Hungary king card to blue player's Tableau, a consession brought by regime change is placed on Hugary's border; 3. Declare Globalization Victory.",
  "Rationale": "Blue player has 3 florins now so can afford buying Sophia Palaiologina card with 2 florins from the market. Among her list of suitors is the King of Hungary, who is the only King unwed in his Throne (the other two kings are in the opponet's Tableau). By playing the card and launching Coronation one-shot, a royal couple is formed and a regime change happend. The blue player can place on concession on the border of Hungary and move the kingdom card of Hungary to its Tableau. Now, the blue player has 3 concessions on the map, which are 2 more than the 1 concession that green player has. Additionally, the blue player already has one more Discovery prestige than the opponent purple player. Therefore, the Globalization Victory winning condition is satisfied.",
