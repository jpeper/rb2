  "Test Description": "Testing winning conditions (Globalization Victory). Test Jihad religious war one-shot.",

  "Answer_str": "1. Purchase --- Spend 3 florins to buy Safavids card from market; 2. Play --- play Safavids card, launch Jihad one-shot, move the Byzantium kingdom card to blue player's Tableau, a consession brought by regime change is placed on Byzantium's border; 3. Declare Globalization Victory.",
  "Rationale": "Blue players have 3 florins now so can afford buying Safavids card with 3 florins from the market. By playing the card and launching Jihad one-shot, the blue player will win Byzantium because the attackers are one blue (believer) knights in the target Byzantium area and two blue (believer) knights in adjcent area (Ottoman), and the defender is only one yellow (hectic) knights in Byzantium. This results in a regime change and the blue player can play on concession on the border of Byzantium and move the kingdom card of Byzantium to its Tableau. Now, the blue player has 3 concessions on the map, which are 2 more than the 1 concession that green player has. Additionally, the blue player already has one more Discovery prestige than the opponent purple player. Therefore, the Globalization Victory winning condition is satisfied.",
