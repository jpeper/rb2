  "Answer_str": "1. Purchase --- Spend 3 florins to buy The Bold card; 2. Play --- play The Bold card, launch conspiracy one-shot, win the France, a consession brought by regime change is placed on border; 3. Declare Globalization Victory.",
  "Rationale": "Blue players have 3 florins now so can afford buying The Bold card with 3 florins from the market. By playing the card and launching conspiracy one-shot, the blue player will win france because the attackers are two knights on the card and the defender is only one knight in France. This results in a regime change and the blue player can play on concession on the border of France. Now, the blue player has 3 concessions on the map, which are 2 more than the 1 concession that purple player has. Additionally, the blue player already has one more Discovery prestige than the opponent purple player. Therefore, the Globalization Victory winning condition is satisfied.",
