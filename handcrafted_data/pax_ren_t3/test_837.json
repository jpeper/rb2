  "Test Description": "Testing winning conditions (Globalization Victory). Test Campain Op.",
  "Difficulty Notes": "Strategy problem while testing winning conditions. Requires understanding game actions like Campain Op. It is very tricky to derive the strategy as you need to decide which kingdom to attack based on the limited florins in hand.",
  "Question": "Given the provided game state, how can the blue player win the game in 3 actions?\n**Please format your response as an ordered JSON list of actions. Each action should follow the format shown below:**\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"West Tableau Ops\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"West Trade Fair\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"Victory\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Format Specifications:\n\nEach list item represents one **action** as a dictionary with the following keys:\n\n1. **\"action\"** (string):\n   Must be one of the following valid actions:\n   `[\"Purchase\", \"Play\", \"Sell\", \"West Tableau Ops\", \"East Tableau Ops\", \"West Trade Fair\", \"East Trade Fair\", \"Victory\"]`",
  "Answer": [
    {
      "action": "East Tableau Ops"
    },
    {
      "action": "West Tableau Ops"
    },
    {
      "action": "Victory"
    }
  ],
  "Answer_str": "1. East Tableau Ops --- launch Campain Op, spend 1 florin to attack Papal States, place one concession on border; 2. West Tableau Ops --- launch Campain Op, spend 1 florin to attack France, place one concession on border; 2. Declare Globalization Victory.",
  "Rationale": "In Campain Op of East tableau, the attacker is one knight in the  Ottoman kingdom and the target Papal States kingdom does not have any knights/rooks to serve as defenders. In Campain Op of West tableau, the attacker is one knight in the England kingdom and the target France kingdom does not have any knights/rooks to serve as defenders. Now, the blue player has 3 concessions on the map, which are 2 more than the 1 concession that green player has. Additionally, the blue player already has one more Discovery prestige than the opponent purple player. Therefore, the Globalization Victory winning condition is satisfied. Note that the blue player only has two florins (Campain ops requires paying 1 florin per attacker) so this is the only posible way to win the game within 3 turns.",
