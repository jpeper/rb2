  "Answer_str": "1. West Tableau Ops --- launch Vote Ops against Papal States, Papal State regime change into Republic; 2. Declare Renaissance Victory.",
  "Rationale": "The blue player launches Vote Ops. Since there are only one blue pawn on the border of the target region, Papal State, the blue player has the majority of concessions and thus win the vote. This results in a regime change and the Papal state king card is flipped into a republic card. Now, the blue player has more republic cards. Additionally, the blue player already has two more Law Prestiges than the opponent purple player. Therefore, the Renaissance Victory winning condition is satisfied.",
