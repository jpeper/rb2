      }
    }
  ],
  "Answer_str": "1. Purchase --- Spend 2 florins to buy The Mary Rose card; 2. Play --- play The Mary Rose card; 3. Declare Globalization Victory.",
  "Rationale": "Blue players have 3 florins now so can afford buying Humanism card with 1 florin. By playing the card, the blue player has one more Discovery prestige than the opponent purple player. Also, the blue player already has 3 concessions on the map, which are 2 more than the 1 concession that purple player has. Therefore, the Globalization Victory winning condition is satisfied.",
