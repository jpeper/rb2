  "Answer_str": "1. West Tableau Ops --- launch Vote Ops against Papal States, Papal State regime change, place one concession on the border of Papal State; 2. Declare Globalization Victory.",
  "Rationale": "The blue player launches Vote Ops. Since there are only one blue pawn on the border of the target region, Papal State, the blue player has the majority of concessions and thus win the vote. This results in a regime change and one more concession can be placed on the border of Papal State. Now, the blue player has 3 concessions on the map, which are 2 more than the 1 concession that green player has. Additionally, the blue player already has one more Discovery prestige than the opponent purple player. Therefore, the Globalization Victory winning condition is satisfied.",
